### Description

ever wanted to store notes on your desktop? well this does just that! no more faffing around with notepad trying to find where u put that .txt file or whateva, with a few clicks here and there you can have a system up where ur notes load up on startup ready and waiting!! includes some 3rd party coding (which i thank you guys!!) and does the job well
